# notes
<h1>hi,</h1>
welcome to my notes page. i'm currently trying to figure out how most things work but y'know. 
this is mostly for my notes for COMP1238 and currently building towards a portfolio.<br>

## Keyboard shortcuts
Shortcuts I frequently use:
- Ctrl-C (copy)
- Ctrl-V (paste)
- Alt-F4 (force close programs)
- Alt-Tab (moves between applications)
- Ctrl-A (select all)
<br>
<hr>
Shortcuts I would like to start using:
- Ctrl-X (cut text)
- Ctrl-W (closing window, but i'm joking here)
Not a lot of keys I can think of that I don't use often since I write blogs.
